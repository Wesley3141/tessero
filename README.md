# Tessero: Personalized Recommendation Platform

Tessero ([tessero.space](http://tessero.space)) is an AI-powered recommendation platform that delivers personalized event and product suggestions through a robust Flask-based API. Developed by a team of AI and software engineering enthusiasts, Tessero leverages machine learning to analyze user interactions and provide tailored recommendations. In 2024, Tessero won the **Wharton Startup Pitch Competition**, recognized for its innovative approach to AI-driven personalization.

## üåü Project Overview

Tessero‚Äôs core is the `TesseroRecommendationEngine`, a machine learning system that processes user-event interactions, event features, and user profiles to generate personalized recommendations. The platform supports real-time filtering by categories, price, location, and dates, with cold-start capabilities for new users. Built with scalability in mind, Tessero uses Flask, Pandas, and a modular API design to serve recommendations efficiently.

## ü§ñ AI/ML & SWE Technologies

- **Flask**: Lightweight web framework for the RESTful API.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data processing for user interactions and event features.
- **TesseroRecommendationEngine**: Custom ML engine for personalized and cold-start recommendations.
- **Pickle**: Model serialization for saving and loading trained models.
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring.
- **Python**: Core language for AI/ML and backend development.

## üé® Innovative Frontend & Design

Tessero‚Äôs frontend is designed to captivate and engage users, combining aesthetic elegance with functional innovation:

- **Responsive Design**: Built with React and Tailwind CSS, the interface adapts seamlessly across desktops, tablets, and mobiles, ensuring accessibility for all users.
- **Interactive Recommendation Feed**: A dynamic, card-based UI displays recommendations with real-time updates as users apply filters (e.g., price, category). Hover effects and smooth animations enhance interactivity.
- **Visual Filters**: Intuitive sliders and dropdowns for price ranges, dates, and categories, styled with vibrant gradients and modern typography, make filtering effortless.
- **Personalization Dashboard**: A user-centric dashboard visualizes past interactions (e.g., clicks, purchases) with colorful charts, powered by Chart.js, fostering engagement.
- **Accessibility-First**: Adheres to WCAG 2.1 standards, with high-contrast themes and keyboard navigation, ensuring inclusivity.
- **Micro-Animations**: Subtle transitions (e.g., fade-ins for new recommendations) create a polished, app-like experience, drawing inspiration from Material Design principles.

These design choices, validated through user testing, contributed to Tessero‚Äôs Wharton win by prioritizing usability and visual appeal alongside AI precision.
